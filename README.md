EasyTech Talent January 2026

### **Project Summary**

This project analyzes sales transaction data to understand how revenue is generated across time, customers, products, and regions. 
The goal was to convert raw sales records into a clear and interactive Excel dashboard that supports management level decision making. 


The analysis focuses on what is happening, where it is happening, and who is driving results.

### **Business Objectives**

The project was designed to answer the following questions:

- How is total sales performance changing over time?

- Which products and categories contribute most to revenue?

- How do customer demographics influence sales outcomes?

- Which regions perform well and which require attention?

- What patterns can guide future sales and marketing decisions?


### **Data Description**

Three datasets were provided and used together:

- Sales data containing transaction level records

- Customer data containing demographic attributes

- Product data containing product and category details

Each dataset was kept separate initially and later connected using unique customer and product identifiers.


### **Data Preparation Process**

The analysis followed a structured workflow:

1. Raw datasets were imported into Excel without modification

2. Sales data was used as the base table

3. Customer and product attributes were added using lookup functions

4. Data types were standardized for dates, numbers, and text fields

5. Calculated columns were created for year, month, and age groups

6. A clean analysis table was converted into an Excel Table for consistency

This approach ensured accuracy and avoided duplication.


### **Analysis Approach**

All analysis was performed using Excel PivotTables and the Data Model.

Key techniques used:

- Aggregation of revenue, orders, and quantity

- Distinct counting of customers

- Time based comparison using year and month

- Segmentation by gender, age group, category, and region

- Interactive filtering using slicers


### **Dashboard Overview**

The final dashboard presents:

- Overall sales performance indicators.

- Monthly sales trend comparison.

- Top performing products and categories.

- Sales contribution by gender and age group.

- Regional sales distribution.

The dashboard updates dynamically based on user selected filters.


### **Key Insights**

- Sales performance is uneven across regions, with the West generating the highest revenue

- The North region shows consistently low sales, indicating potential growth opportunities

- Customers aged 28 to 37 contribute the largest share of revenue

- Female customers account for a higher portion of total sales

- Revenue is concentrated in a small number of top performing products



### **Business Implications**

- Regional strategies should prioritize improving performance in underperforming areas

- Marketing efforts should focus on high value customer segments

- Product dependency risk exists due to reliance on a few top sellers


## **Conclusion**

- This project demonstrates how Excel can be used to transform raw sales data into clear, actionable insights.
  
- The dashboard enables quick performance assessment and supports informed decision making without technical complexity.
